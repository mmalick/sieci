# IP Subnet Calculator
IP Subnet Calculator is a tool designed to analyze IP addresses, divide networks into subnets, and calculate various subnetting parameters for IPv4 addressing. It supports both Classful Subnetting and Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM).

Features:
-Detects the IP address class (A, B, C).
-Determines the default network mask based on the class.
-Calculates the number of bits required for host addressing.
-Generates subnet masks dynamically.
-Computes subnet details, including:
-First and last host addresses.
-Broadcast address.
-Number of subnets and available hosts per subnet.
-Implements VLSM for efficient IP address allocation.
